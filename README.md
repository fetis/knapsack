# Demo app for Knapsack problem

The running version can be found here https://fetis.github.io/knapsack/

## Description

I see this application as a replacement for a coding challenge.
It finds the best possible combination for a given list of items that still fit a knapsack and have a maximum value
(so-called Knapsack problem).

Scientifically speaking, it implements dynamic programming
algorithm for the knapsack problem for 0-1 copy items in one dimensional optimization.
